New York- Rehabilitation of "Hare-brained" featuring ataraxic Bugs Bunny

ACME Industries recruits former Warner Bros character Bugs Bunny as Pyrrhonic VP of Marketing. Joining the team is Roadrunner, and Daffy Duck. The addition to ACME represents the latest salvo in opposition research against Wiley Coyote and Elmer Fudd's 2024 primary campaigns.

After being turned away from Orbis Business Intelligence offices in London for not being human, nor wearing shirts or shoes, Bunny, Runner, and Duck returned to the United States. Investigator in Chief Maigret spotted the trio being turned away from FusionGPS in Washington DC for similar reasons, when he invited them to Surveillance test at the Washington Monument. After successfully identifying several handlers, the animals were hired to exfiltrate a political prisoner at the Smithsonian's National Zoo. Roadrunner was tasked with unlocking the gates and cages with a cloned key, while Duck served as a lookout. Bugs Bunny was tasked with leading an Emperor tamarin out of a cage and absconding towards the exit. A private plane operating outside of DC airspace awaited the Tamarin in Virginia, and was flown to Brazil in the early morning hours. The Tamarin was provided with its crown of the Amazon, by local custodians which it lost in 1972. Aging, frail, but not out, the Emperor Tamarin claimed that great prosperity will return to the Amazon, and thanked the revolutionaries who were involved in the bloodless coup that deposed the Jaguar, who is currently in exile in France for a racketeering scandal.
